# Computational-Geometry-Package-
Implementation of various Computational Geometry Algorithms 
The package contains implementation for different Convex-Hull algorithms(Grahams-scan, Divide And Conquer, Jarvis March ...)
implementation of DCEL(Doubly Connected Edge List) Data structure.
implementation of polygon triangulation algorithms (subtracting ears, y_monotone triangulation)
and much more.
